          <ul class="resume"><em>Managing Director, Knowledge Management at Charles Schwab</em></ul>
          <li class="resume">I led a team of 12 web developers in formulating content strategies with our Product Owners, Marketing, and Business Unit Leaders on delivering content to Client Support.</li>
          <li class="resume">I had responsibility to lead the team in the web design, templates and content structure of the knowledge portal supporting the content.</li>
          <li class="resume">I developed an automated process with my developers to create a forms library to deliver an improved search experience as well as the ability to email and branded email with send back instructions.

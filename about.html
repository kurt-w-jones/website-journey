            <p> As a leader, Kurt Jones has 15+ yearsâ€™ experience in all aspects of application and middleware deployment, validation, delivery and support. Kurt builds relationships and connections to his key partners, team members, and customers to assure
              a constant state of satisfaction. He is a problem-solver and looks to organize complex challenges into bit-sized pieces to deliver a solution. He has honed this skill through large projects and environments at Fortune 500 companies such
              as Charles Schwab and IBM. Colleagues find him to be approachable, trustworthy, very organized and committed to constant improvement. He specializes in advanced planning and thoughtful review of all variables to identify potential options
              for a solution.</p>
            <p>In his recent roles at Charles Schwab, Kurt led teams responsible for supporting and building corporate intranet systems and applications. He led a three-year program to deploy content, document management, and social collaboration technologies
              across the firm. In this role he was part of the leadership team that transformed the enterprise's intranet into an efficient and effective collaborative knowledge sharing platform. He also introduced Schwab to the services of the Digital
              Workplace Group and led the benchmarking of intranet services to measure customer satisfaction and effectiveness. He helped to host and present at several DWG events with leaders from other corporate members. He helped to establish a content
              governance system with cross-functional leaders to meet regulatory and compliance rules for content. Kurt led a process improvement effort with his engineering team to automate SharePoint builds and monitoring efforts.</p>
            <p>Kurt began his career at IBM as part of a technical help desk providing Unix/AIX support to customers. His relationship building with customers was immediately identified by management and he was asked to move to a project management role
              to help establish support services for a larger host of customers. It was in this role that Kurt certified his credentials to become a Project Management Professional (PMP). His focus on customers and relationships led to management opportunities
              both within Project Management and later IT Middleware departments.</p>
            <p>Kurt has a BS in Accounting from the University of Northern Colorado where he ran the track team and this passion continues today.</p>

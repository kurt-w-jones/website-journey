              <p><strong>A leader who thrives on building deep relations with customers and teams to provide stellar customer service.  The capability to take the chaos of projects, resources, and issues and optimize them efficiently.</strong></p></td>
              <td style="vertical-align:top;"><p> As a leader, Kurt Jones has 15+ years’ experience in all aspects of application and middleware deployment, validation, delivery and support.  Kurt builds relationships and connections to his key partners, team members, and customers to assure a constant state of satisfaction.  He is a problem-solver and looks to organize complex challenges into bit-sized pieces to deliver a solution.  He has honed this skill through large projects and environments at Fortune 500 companies such as Charles Schwab and IBM.  Colleagues find him to be approachable, trustworthy, very organized and committed to constant improvement.  He specializes in advanced planning and thoughtful review of all variables to identify potential options for a solution.</p>
                  <p>During his time at Charles Schwab, Kurt was part of the leadership that transformed the intranet into a more collaborative and knowledge sharing platform.  He led a three-year program to deploy content and collaboration platforms, such as SharePoint, to the firm to unlock the power of knowledge sharing and saved the firm $400,000.  Kurt initiated a partnership with DigitalWorkplace Group to develop benchmarking and metrics for the intranet to assure it provided value to users through measurement.  He increased the customer satisfaction rate of users over 50%.  He led a cross-functional leadership team in designing a content governance system to confirm the accuracy and validity of content both for customers and field organizations using it.</p>
                  <p>Before his time at Charles Schwab, Kurt had begun the development of his leadership skills during several different roles at IBM.  Kurt progressed from his Unix Admin role into a Project Manager due to his keen ability to connect with customers as part of his service.  His management wanted him to deliver that type of relationship to a broad range of customers while setting up their services.  The project management team grew as customers grew and he was tapped to manage half of the team as part of the expansion.  It was during this time that Kurt certified his project management skills by becoming a Project Management Professional (PMP).  Kurt’s work with both customers and service teams led him to manage a team of Middleware Architects that focused on technical planning to solve the business objectives of his customers.</p>
                  <p>Kurt grew up in Colorado enjoying the great outdoors.  He attended the University of Northern Colorado where he received his Bachelor's degree in Accounting.  He was a student-athlete at UNC, sprinting for the University’s track team where he was named a Team Captain for two seasons.  His passion for running continues today where you can find him doing 5k and 10k races.</p>

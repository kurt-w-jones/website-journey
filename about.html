          <h2> About The Coder</h2>
          <p>I have always been curious on how software works and how people figure out so many different ways and languages to make it do what it does.  I finally decided it was time to tap the curiosity and learn for myself.  Learning code is not easy and it takes both time and discipline.  You need some determination to stay the course even when your code is doing something you don't understand as well as discipline to form a habit of coding every day.</p>

          <h2> Purpose of the Site</h2>
          <p>I have been a part of the technology field for most of my career but had never moved in a direction to learn to code.  As I enter the middle part of my life I have an interest learning more about the coding revolution and how it is moving into all phases of my life.  I have never coded so I'm starting at the beginning learning HTML and CSS and how to build a website like this one.  I plan catalog my efforts and projects on the site as I learn and develop more skills.</p>

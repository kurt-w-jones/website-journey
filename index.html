          <h2> Purpose of the Site</h2>
          <p>I have been a part of the technology field for most of my career but had never learned to code.  As I enter the middle part of my life I have an interest in learning more about the coding revolution and how it is moving into all phases of my life.  I'm starting at the beginning learning HTML and CSS and how to build a website like this one.  I plan to catalog my efforts and projects on the site as I learn and develop more skills.</p>

          <h2> Resources of the Site</h2>
          <p>There is a huge amount of information posted across the web that anyone can Google to try to find information about how to learn to code and what are the tools and resources necessary for such a journey?  I wanted this site to provide anyone with the steps I took and tools I used as an absolute novice of coding.  A lot of the instruction you will find on the web is written by people that do code and as such they utilize jargon, tools, and examples that assume knowledge of the coding realm to the frustration of a novice coder.  I will look to make my site as straight-forward as possible on how I setup this site, resources I used to learn to code and anything else I believe will be valuable knowledge.  In the Projects section one of my first projects is showing the architecture of the tools and systems used to make this site available.</p>
          <h3>Beginning Checklist of Resources</h3>
          <ol class="l">
            <li>You will need to buy a domain name (my domain name here is midlife-coder.com) from a Registrar like <a href="https://www.godaddy.com" target="_blank">GoDaddy</a> or <a href="https://www.hostgator.com" target="_blank">HostGator</a> or <a href="https://www.bluehost.com" target="_blank">Bluehost</a>.  I used GoDaddy for this site, it costs about $12 a year to just register the name.</li>
            <li>Decide if you really want to build your website from scratch with all the learning you'll be doing (that's what I have done) or if you just want to learn about websites but would rather skip all the coding part.  This is important.  This site and projects are build from scratch and the instruction will follow that.  When you register at a place like GoDaddy you'll see an option to purchase a Wordpress site where you can get all the templates and things you need without having to code much. Keep following below if you're going for scratch.</li>
            <li>Find a code editing tool you like as that is where you will actually type in your HTML, CSS or other styling items for your website.  There are many tools available, many for free.  Here are a few free tools you can look at.  <a href="http://brackets.io" target="_blank">Brackets</a> is a simple, good-looking editor to use as well as <a href="http://www.notepad-plus-plus.org" target="_blank">Notepad++</a> which seems to be a long-time favorite based on what I read throughout Google.  I personally chose <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> because it has integration with GitHub which is a cloud version control tool and is part of my architecture under Projects I wanted to put together.</li>

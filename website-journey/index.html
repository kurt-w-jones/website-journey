<h1> My Mid-life Adventure on Learning How to Code </h1>
<p>In order to help others that may have a similar passion or desire to learn code and have no background or education on coding (like me), I wanted to document all the steps I take.  There is a lot of information on the web about starting out on web development and connecting your code to cloud resources and the like.  Most of it was written by coders who don't realize that when they say "make sure you install Git" true newbie folks might not know what Git is, where/how to download it, or how to begin to use it.  Since we are new we are likely going to online forums or maybe free classes trying to learn what HTML, CSS, Javascript, or any other language is all about and not understanding a lot of what we find on the web.  Much of the teachings and online forum information is also filled with jargon and assumptions that you "should know" some of this already.</p>

<p>Now throw in an instance where someone is toward the middle of their life and sparked an interest in learning how to code either for career knowledge or to use for community efforts (one of my reasons) to help nonprofits and some of the jargon and lack of clear instruction can be frustrating.  My goal for this website is three-fold: 1) To provide clear information on how I went through my journey in hopes it makes things easier for others, 2) A place to house projects I complete for my personal record, and 3) To provide little bit of information about myself.</p>
